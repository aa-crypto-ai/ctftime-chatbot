Who can vote?
For some events public weight voting is open from the begining of CTF event and a week after (or by the end of the current year if it happens). Team members of last years top 50 and teams scored > 0 points can vote. 2021 change: only teams who participated at least in two events can vote. The vote counts on behalf of your team. Important change: starting from 2021 only team players who joined team before the event can vote. When multiple teammates vote, we take the average. If you change your mind, you can re-vote, but only once. Your first vote is discarded then. For the first time events and events having weight less than 25 weight vote limit is 25*. For the others is last years weight multiplied by X. X = 2 for attack-defence events and 1.5 for the rest. Event organizers and winning team can't vote. N.B. We don't like cheaters or spammers. *If there are more than one event during the first year - all of them will get maximum weight of 25.
