I don't have a team but wanna play
Well, you can play alone or try to get a team. It's more fun to compete with a team. You can hire people from your university or your job. Don't forget to provide your skills in Profile page and check "I'm looking for the team" - may be someone will invite you. Also, you can try to use our talent search interface.
